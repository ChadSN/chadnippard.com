                        During the 2025 Global Game Jam in Brighton, I contributed as a 3D modeller for <strong>All Hail
                            The Bubble</strong>, an isometric couch co-op game (1-4 players) where players switch
                        between cultists to fulfil commandments given by a sentient bubble. Completing these
                        commandments extends the bubble's dwindling lifespan, but if its life runs out, the players
                        lose. Working within the 48-hour time limit, I created a range of low-poly 3D models to bring
                        the cult's house to life.
                    </p>

                        Initially, I had hoped to take on a programming role in Unity for this year's Global Game Jam.
                        However, after joining the team we affectionately called "Bubble Cult," I couldn't pass up the
                        opportunity to work with such an incredible and talented group of people. I decided to switch
                        roles and contribute as a 3D modeller, offering as much support as I could to bring our project
                        to life.

                    <h3>3D Asset Contributions</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>House:</strong> Modelled the house following a blueprint of the floorplan drawn by
                            our 2D artist.</li>
                        <li><strong>Furniture:</strong> Created a variety of furniture, ranging from everyday living
                            items to objects inspired by the commandments and cultist themes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Foliage:</strong> Designed a simple tree using multiple extrusions from a cylinder,
                            adding randomisation for uniqueness. Trees were scattered and rescaled to avoid repetition.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Key Techniques and Tools</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Bevelling:</strong> Used the bevel tool to smooth sharp edges on most objects (in
                            honour of the bubble) and to create stairs by adjusting bevel settings.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wireframe modifier:</strong> Created a disco ball by adding a wireframe modifier,
                            adjusting thickness, "keeping original", and applying a reflective material for a polished
                            finish.</li>
                        <li><strong>Booleans:</strong> Applied boolean operations to cut precise holes for doorways and
                            the pool in the shrine room.</li>
                        <li><strong>UV Mapping and Basic Texturing:</strong> Ensured assets were efficiently textured to
                            maintain a consistent visual style. Textures drawn by our 2D artist were applied to walls,
                            flooring, posters, and carpets.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Collaboration and Workflow</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>GDD:</strong> Collaborated on a Game Design Document (GDD) to align mechanics,
                            narrative, and art style across the team.</li>
                        <li><strong>Integration with Game Engine:</strong> Exported optimised models for seamless
                            integration into the Unity engine.</li>
                        <li><strong>Team Coordination:</strong> Worked closely with designers and programmers to meet
                            asset requirements and maintain consistent visual themes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Adaptability Under Time Constraints:</strong> Delivered high-quality assets within
                            the 48-hour deadline, focusing on key elements while maintaining design cohesion.</li>
                        <li><strong>GitHub for Task Management:</strong> Used GitHub's project boards feature with "To
                            Do," "In Progress," and "Done" labels to track progress and manage workload effectively.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        The 2025 Global Game Jam was an unforgettable experience that showcased the power of
                        collaboration under tight deadlines. Contributing as a 3D modeller allowed me to grow creatively
                        while working alongside a team of talented individuals. Together, we brought <strong>All Hail
                            The Bubble</strong> to life, blending artistic vision and gameplay into a unique and
                        cohesive project.
