                <p>
                    Welcome to the first blog post for <strong>Rooty Tooty</strong>, a board game-inspired western
                    shooter. In Rooty
                    Tooty, players face off in 1v1 or 2v2 shootouts, using unique character traits, wild weapons, and
                    tactical cards.
                    The action unfolds on a 2 by 20 grid, which immediately made me think about how to handle
                    character movement in a smart and
                    flexible way. That's where A* pathfinding comes in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game is still a work in progress, being built in the Unity engine. It was originally designed as
                    a physical board game
                    by my friend Josh Ruff. After Andy Connacher and I play-tested it, Josh invited us to help bring it
                    to life as a digital
                    couch co-op / online game. Andy took the lead on 3D art, I stepped in as lead programmer, and
                    Josh - who is the game's
                    lead designer and director - is continuing to develop the core mechanics while also handling 2D art
                    and 3D modelling.
                    Oli Ruff joined the team as our sound designer, and the original 2D concept art was created by Moe
                    McKinney.
                    It's a collaborative and evolving project, and this devlog is my way of sharing the technical side
                    of building
                    Rooty Tooty from the ground up.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next academic year I'll be learning about A* pathfinding at university, but I wanted to
                    get a head start
                    and implement it myself for this project. My first step was to organise my Unity scripts with a
                    clear folder structure, making it easier to manage different systems as the game grows. I have no
                    doubt that I'll be learning much more about folder structure and script separation on this journey,
                    and things are bound to get moved about, alas, here's how I
                    set up my scripts directory:
                </p>

                <strong>Cell.cs</strong>
                <p>
                    To represent each space on the board, I created a simple <code>Cell</code> class. Each cell tracks
                    its position, whether it's walkable, if it's occupied, and if it provides cover. These properties
                    are essential for pathfinding and gameplay logic.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">// Cell essentials
public Vector2Int GridPosition { get; }
public bool IsWalkable { get; set; }
public bool IsOccupied { get; set; }
public bool IsCover { get; set; }
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    For A* pathfinding, each cell also stores its movement costs and a reference to its parent cell,
                    which helps reconstruct the path. This keeps the system flexible and easy to expand as the game
                    grows.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">// Pathfinding variables
public int GCost, HCost;
public int FCost => GCost + HCost;
public Cell Parent { get; set; }
</code></pre>
                <strong>GridManager.cs</strong>
                <p>
                    With the <code>Cell</code> class ready, I needed a way to build and manage the grid in Unity. The
                    <code>GridManager</code> script handles creating all the cells, checking which are walkable or
                    provide cover, and making it easy to find neighbours for pathfinding.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">// Singleton pattern for easy access
public static GridManager Instance { get; private set; }

private void Awake()
{
    Instance = this;
    BuildGrid();
}
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    The grid automatically updates if I change its size or layout in the editor. I use collision checks
                    to decide if a cell should be walkable or marked as cover, so I can just drop obstacles into the
                    scene and the grid updates itself - no manual setup needed.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">// Check if a cell is walkable or cover
bool walkable = !Physics.CheckSphere(worldPoint, CollisionProbeRadius, UnwalkableMask);
bool isCover = Physics.CheckSphere(worldPoint, CollisionProbeRadius, CoverMask);
</code></pre>
                <strong>AStarPathFinder.cs</strong>
                <p>
                    With the grid and cells in place, I was ready to tackle the heart of the system: A* pathfinding. My
                    <code>AStarPathFinder</code> script finds the shortest path between two cells, taking into account
                    movement limits and obstacles like barrels or occupied cells.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">// Finds a path between two cells
public static List<Cell> FindPath(Cell startCell, Cell targetCell, int maxMoveAmount = 4)
{
    // ... open/closed set logic, pathfinding loop
}
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    I use Manhattan distance as the heuristic, since movement is only up, down, left, or right. Once the
                    target is reached, the script retraces the path using parent pointers. This approach keeps
                    pathfinding efficient and easy to debug for a board game layout.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">// Manhattan distance heuristic
private static int GetHeuristic(Cell a, Cell b)
{
    return Mathf.Abs(a.GridPosition.x - b.GridPosition.x) + Mathf.Abs(a.GridPosition.y - b.GridPosition.y);
}
</code></pre>
                <strong>PathVisualiser.cs</strong>
                <p>
                    After getting A* working, I wanted to see the paths in the scene. My <code>PathVisualiser</code>
                    script spawns a highlight prefab at each cell along the path, using a transparent material so it
                    sits just above the board.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">// Visualises a path by spawning highlight prefabs
public class PathVisualiser : MonoBehaviour
{
    public List<Cell> CurrentPath;
    public GameObject cellHighlightPrefab;
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    The highlights update every frame, changing colour based on cell state - red for obstacles, yellow
                    for
                    the path, and green for the destination. This visual feedback makes it much easier to debug and
                    tweak pathfinding logic.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">// Example: setting highlight colour
if (renderer != null)
{
    renderer.material.color = isObstacle ? Color.red : PathColor;
}
</code></pre>
                <strong>CameraOrbit.cs</strong>
                <p>
                    To give players a great view of the action, I wrote a <code>CameraOrbit</code> script. It lets you
                    smoothly orbit, zoom, and pan around the board using the mouse and keyboard, with clamped angles and
                    smooth transitions for a polished feel.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">// Basic orbit and zoom setup
public Transform target;
public float distance = 15f;
public float xSpeed = 120f;
public float ySpeed = 80f;
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    The camera can also follow a player character, keeping the action centred. All movement is handled
                    in <code>LateUpdate</code> for smoothness, and panning is clamped so you never lose sight of the
                    board.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">// Orbit and zoom logic
if (Input.GetMouseButton(1)) { /* ... */ }
distance = Mathf.Lerp(distance, targetDistance, Time.deltaTime * zoomLerpSpeed);
</code></pre>
                <strong>GridInputController.cs</strong>
                <p>
                    With the board, pathfinding, and camera working, I needed a way for players to interact.
                    <code>GridInputController</code> handles mouse input for selecting cells and moving characters,
                    restricting movement to the current move limit and only allowing one player to act at a time.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">// Handles player input for grid navigation and movement
public class GridInputController : MonoBehaviour
{
    public PathVisualiser pathVisualiser;
    public TurnManager turnManager;
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    The script uses raycasts to detect which cell is hovered, previews the path, and starts movement
                    when a valid cell is clicked. Input is disabled while moving to prevent bugs from rapid clicks.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">// Handles mouse input for cell selection and movement
void HandleMouse() { /* ... raycast and pathfinding logic ... */ }
</code></pre>
                <strong>PlayerCharacter.cs</strong>
                <p>
                    <code>PlayerCharacter</code> represents each character on the board, tracking health, movement
                    range, and which cell they occupy. When a move is triggered, it updates cell occupancy and animates
                    the character smoothly from cell to cell.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">
// Moves the character along the given path
public IEnumerator MoveAlongPath(List<Cell> path, float unitsPerSecond = 8f)
{
    foreach (var cell in path)
    {
        // ... update occupancy and move ...
    }
}
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    The script also supports spawning at specific cells and handling offsets for multiple players in one
                    cell. This keeps everything tidy and avoids visual overlap.
                </p>
                <strong>PlayerController.cs</strong>
                <p>
                    <code>PlayerController</code> is a lightweight script for enabling or disabling input for a player.
                    This is especially useful in a turn-based system, keeping input logic clean and ensuring only the
                    active player can act.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">// Handles enabling and disabling input for a player character
public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    public PlayerCharacter character;
    private bool inputEnabled = false;
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
                <strong>TurnManager.cs</strong>
                <p>
                    To tie everything together, <code>TurnManager</code> spawns each player at their starting position,
                    assigns unique offsets for sharing cells, and manages the turn order. Only one player can act at a
                    time, and the camera focuses on the current player.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">// Manages turn order and player spawning
public class TurnManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public List<GridInputController> players;
    private int currentPlayerIndex = 0;
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    When a turn ends, the script waits briefly, then advances to the next player and starts their turn.
                    This keeps gameplay smooth and makes it easy to add more players or tweak the turn order.
                </p>
                <strong>CameraController.cs</strong>
                <p>
                    <code>CameraController</code> acts as a bridge between the turn system and the camera, telling the
                    camera to focus on the current player at the start of each turn. This keeps the action front and
                    centre and makes the game feel polished.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">// Focuses the camera on the current player
public void FocusOnPlayer(PlayerCharacter player)
{
    if (cameraOrbit != null && player != null)
    {
        cameraOrbit.desiredTargetPosition = player.transform.position;
        cameraOrbit.followPlayer = player.transform;
        cameraOrbit.ResetPan();
    }
}
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Writing and building this system for Rooty Tooty has been a fantastic learning experience. I've had
                    the chance to dive deep into pathfinding, grid management, and Unity's component system, all while
                    keeping the code flexible enough for future features. Seeing everything come together - from the
                    grid
                    and pathfinding to the camera and turn management - has been incredibly satisfying.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along the way, I've learned the value of breaking complex problems into smaller, manageable scripts
                    and the importance of visual feedback for debugging and polish. There's still plenty to explore,
                    like adding AI opponents, more advanced movement, and much more, but I'm excited for what's next.
                    Thanks for reading!
