            <section>
                <p>
                    Last time, I wrote about pathfinding and grid-based movement - this time I've developed and will
                    talk about the overall menu flow, game setup system, and how Rooty Tooty elegantly
                    transitions from its dynamic main menu into live gameplay. There's a surprising amount going on
                    under the hood
                    to make it feel smooth, modular, and future-ready.
                </p>

                <strong>GameSetupData: The Backbone</strong>
                <p>
                    At the centre of everything is a static class called <code>GameSetupData</code>. This isn't a
                    <code>ScriptableObject</code>, and it doesn't live in a scene. Instead, it holds persistent session
                    data like player count, team
                    mode, controller assignments, selected characters, CPU flags, and arena selection. It's accessible
                    from
                    any script without needing instantiation, making it ideal for storing game state between scenes.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">// Inside GameSetupData.cs
public static int NumPlayers;
public static int[] CharacterSelections;
public static ArenaInfo SelectedArenaInfo;
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    When players choose characters and arenas, the data goes into <code>GameSetupData</code>, and the
                    gameplay scene pulls directly from it.
                </p>

                <strong>ScriptableObjects: Characters & Arenas</strong>
                <p>
                    Two key systems use Unity <code>ScriptableObject</code> assets: <code>CharacterInfo</code> and
                    <code>ArenaInfo</code>. These act as templates - one for playable characters and the other for
                    playable arenas. Each prefab
                    is assigned a ScriptableObject, and those objects store descriptive metadata, UI portraits, movement
                    stats, and
                    more. It keeps configuration data out of prefabs and makes balancing easier across the board.
                </p>

                <strong>Main Menu Flow</strong>
                <p>
                    Rooty Tooty begins in the <code>MainMenu</code> scene, with the camera set looking over the town.
                    From here, players choose between <code>Local</code>, <code>Settings</code> (currently a
                    placeholder), or <code>Quit</code>. Selecting "Local" initiates the full multiplayer setup flow.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each panel - from team mode to character select - is part of a smooth, stylised UI experience.
                    As players move through the menu, the camera doesn't just cut between screens. It lerps - easing
                    from one hand-crafted camera transform to another - revealing different corners of the blockout
                    town.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The world scene itself loads additively in the background via Unity's scene streaming. Andy created
                    a quick and temporary blockout in Blender in under 5 minutes (it was impressively fast) that let me
                    visualise panel positions and test transitions. Later, after a proper design session with Andy, Josh
                    and myself,
                    we refined the town layout using physical paper cut-outs to map out where key buildings and arena
                    tiles would sit around the town. That blockout became the foundation of what is seen in the
                    background of the menu.
                </p>

                <strong>Panel Progression</strong>
                <p>
                    Menu navigation is handled by <code>MenuManager.cs</code>, which controls the current panel, camera
                    target,
                    and manages transitions with a bit of polish. The order is as follows:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>MainMenu Panel</strong> - entry point with "Local" as the launch option.</li>
                    <li><strong>LocalCoopSetup Panel</strong> - here players choose 1v1 or 2v2. This sets
                        <code>NumPlayers</code> and <code>TeamMode</code> in <code>GameSetupData</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>CharacterSelectPanel</strong> - shows 2 or 4 character slots depending on team mode.
                        Character choices are saved to <code>GameSetupData.CharacterSelections</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>ArenaSelectPanel</strong> - lets you pick from available arenas. When one is selected,
                        its <code>ArenaInfo</code> is saved into <code>GameSetupData.SelectedArenaInfo</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>GameSetupPanel</strong> - final review screen showing all selections: characters, arena,
                        and mode. The "Play" button starts the match.</li>
                </ol>

                <strong>LocalCoopSetupController.cs</strong>
                <p>
                    This script captures the 1v1 or 2v2 selection, sets the team mode, and pushes the flow forward. It's
                    simple but critical - everything else hinges on the correct number of player slots and controller
                    inputs being prepared.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">GameSetupData.NumPlayers = 2;
GameSetupData.TeamMode = 2;
menuManager.ShowCharacterSelectPanel();
</code></pre>

                <strong>CharacterSelectPanel.cs</strong>
                <p>
                    Character select adapts dynamically: if you're in 1v1, two player slots are shown; if 2v2, all four
                    appear. Players navigate a grid of characters (pulled from <code>CharacterInfo</code> assets) and
                    select one each. Once
                    filled, it triggers a "Next" button to move on.
                </p>

                <strong>ArenaSelectPanel.cs</strong>
                <p>
                    In this panel, players choose through unlockable and unlocked arenas. Locked ones show a brief
                    description on how to unlock them.
                    Each arena when selected preview their location in the town via the world camera and a highlight
                    prefab. The
                    chosen arena is
                    stored in
                    <code>GameSetupData.SelectedArenaInfo</code>.
                </p>

                <strong>GameSetupPanel.cs</strong>
                <p>
                    The final panel gives players a chance to confirm everything: team mode, characters, and arena.
                    This is the last stop before gameplay starts - and pressing the "Play" button kicks off the scene
                    load.
                </p>

                <strong>World Streaming & Play Button</strong>
                <p>
                    Pressing play triggers the <code>GameLoader</code> script. Behind the scenes, Unity unloads the
                    <code>MainMenu</code> scene and loads the <code>Gameplay</code> scene additively, while keeping the
                    persistent
                    <code>World</code> scene in memory. This keeps transitions fast, reduces loading stutter, and allows
                    for seamless visuals between menu and in-game environment.
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-csharp">// In GameLoader.cs
SceneManager.UnloadSceneAsync("MainMenu");
SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync("Gameplay", LoadSceneMode.Additive);
</code></pre>

                <strong>Gameplay-Side Scripts: TurnManager, GridInputController & PlayerCharacter</strong>
                <p>
                    On the gameplay side, I updated key scripts to read from <code>GameSetupData</code>:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>TurnManager</code> now spawns the correct number of players based on
                        <code>NumPlayers</code>, assigns
                        characters from <code>CharacterSelections</code>, and positions the arena using
                        <code>SelectedArenaInfo.glowPoint</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li><code>GridInputController</code> disables input except for the active player in the turn
                        sequence.</li>
                    <li><code>PlayerCharacter</code> initialises with the right scriptable-character data and spawns
                        exactly in the preset grid cell.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    All of this ties gameplay setup directly back to your menu selections, making the flow feel seamless
                    and cohesive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The entire system now feels tightly integrated - a user journey that starts with an overlook of the
                    town and
                    ends in a shootout without breaking immersion. And all of it driven by centralised data,
                    well-structured
                    panels, and a background world that feels alive.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the next post, I'll hopefully have a turn phase system - movement, shooting, and card play -
                    as well as how each character
                    executes actions during their round. But for now, I'm thrilled with how the game is stitching
                    together, and hopefully next time each character will appear differently rather than appearing as
                    capsule placeholders.
                </p>

                <p>Thanks again for following along, and be sure to keep up with the blogs.</p>
