                <h2>Hey there!<br>I'm Chad Nippard</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm an undergraduate studying Computer Science for Games at the University of Brighton. Born and
                    raised in Brighton, I'm passionate about writing, designing, and most of all, creating immersive
                    worlds and games. Whether it's crafting digital experiences or bringing new ideas to life, I'm
                    always excited to build and explore new possibilities.
                </p>
                <h3>My Career so far</h3>
                <p>
                    Over the years, my hobbies in creative writing, digital design, and game development grew alongside
                    various simple jobs, where I've worked on solo and collaborative game projects, continually honing
                    my skills. I began freelancing as a logo designer, before shifting my career focus to data analysis.
                    It was during this time that I made the decision to fully commit to the gaming industry. I applied
                    to the University of Brighton for a degree in Computer Science for Games. Now, as a full-time
                    student, I am focused on pursuing my passion, with aspirations to build a career in the gaming
                    industry upon completing my degree.
                </p>
